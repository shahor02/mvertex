1) clone the package as
git clone https://github.com/shahor02/mvertex.git
cd mvertex

2) download from the alien some mc data (here is the example of pA data):
alisync -j5 @lst266208esd.txt
alisync -j5 @lst266208galice.txt
alisync -j5 @lst266208kin.txt
(the files will be copied to `pwd`/..alien_path, i.e. directories `pwd`/alice/sim/2017/LHC17f3b_cent/266208/...)
and create the input list
find `pwd`/alice/sim/2017/LHC17f3b_cent/266208 -name "AliESDs.root" > esds.txt

To run the vertex reconstruction in aliroot do:
1) load/compile packages as
.x prep.C
2) run event building and vertex reconstruction as

esd2plp(nevent, nplpDef, inputlist)
where:
nevent: number of events to compose
nplpDef: number of single events (from input) list to mix for every event
if nplpDef<0, then the |nplpDef| will be used as Poissonian mean, i.e. events will be composed of gRandom->Poisson(-nplpDef)
single events from MC (avoiding empty event generation)
if nplpDef>0, exactly int(nplpDef) events will be mixed randomly.
Every generated event will be prepared by picking randomly N MC events (with N according to nplpDef definition), putting
their tracks to single pool and running the vertexing over this pull.
After each event we print reconstructed vertices, generated ones and vertices reconstructed (OrigRec:) in separate events in the official MC.e.g.
Vertices found: 3

Thus, calling esd2plp(100, 1, "esds.txt") will create 100 events, each made out of just 1 event from the original MC.
esd2plp(100, 2, "esds.txt") will create 100 events each made of 2 MC events (collisions)
esd2plp(100, -2, "esds.txt") will create 100 events each made according to Poissonian distribution with mean=2
